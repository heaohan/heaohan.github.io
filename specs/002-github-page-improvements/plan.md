# Implementation Plan: Explore GitHub Page Popular Implementations and Suggest Improvements

**Branch**: `002-github-page-improvements` | **Date**: 2026-03-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-github-page-improvements/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature aims to analyze popular GitHub Pages implementations, extract best practices, and generate actionable, prioritized suggestions for improving this Jekyll-based site. The plan includes research on top repositories, comparison with the current site, and a tracking mechanism for applied improvements.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Ruby (Jekyll 4.x), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Jekyll, Beautiful Jekyll theme, Bundler, GitHub Pages, optional: static analysis tools, accessibility tools  
**Storage**: Static files (Markdown, HTML, YAML, assets)  
**Testing**: Manual review, accessibility testing, optional: HTMLProofer, pa11y, Lighthouse  
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (static hosting), Linux/macOS/Windows for local dev  
**Project Type**: Static website (personal/portfolio/blog)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads (<1s for main pages), Lighthouse performance score >90  
**Constraints**: Must remain compatible with GitHub Pages and Beautiful Jekyll; no server-side code; all improvements must be static-site friendly  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user personal site, ~10-100 pages/posts, moderate asset count


## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Gates:**
- Code must follow clear, consistent style guides; linting/formatting required; remove dead code and unused dependencies.
- All features must include automated or manual tests. For static JS in Jekyll, minimal automated JS test is required for core logic; manual and accessibility testing is sufficient for UI.
- User interfaces and interactions must be consistent, accessible, and reviewed for clarity and design pattern adherence.
- All features must meet defined performance targets (fast page loads, optimized resources, no regressions).
- All code must be open source, compatible with Beautiful Jekyll, and follow security best practices.
- All changes require code review and must pass CI before merging; documentation must be updated for user-facing/architectural changes.

**Status:**
- No violations detected at this stage. All requirements are compatible with the repo's constitution and workflow.

**Structure Decision**: This is a static Jekyll site using the Beautiful Jekyll theme. All improvements will be made within the existing Jekyll structure, primarily in `_config.yml`, `_includes/`, `_layouts/`, `assets/`, and content Markdown files. No backend or dynamic code is present or required.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
