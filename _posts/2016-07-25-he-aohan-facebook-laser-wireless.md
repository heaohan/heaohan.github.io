The tracking and position-adjustment of detector, making sure the detector collects laser signal correctly, remains a problem for light wireless communication. Previously, we need some complex mechanical systems. Now, Facebook's lab uses fluroscent material, which can abosrd blue light (signal) and emit green light, to replace the previous solution.

>“The optical fibers absorb light coming from any direction over a large area, and the emitted light travels inside the optical fiber, which funnels the light to a small, very fast photodetector.”

Now we just need another improvement of optical fibers, which can provide us the fluorescent optical fibers that can absort infrared laser light and emit it, to open the gate of light wireless communication.
