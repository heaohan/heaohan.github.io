###Spatial light modulator:

> Usually, an SLM modulates **the intensity of the light beam**. However, it is also possible to produce devices that modulate **the phase of the beam** or both the intensity and the phase simultaneously.

> SLMs have been used as a component in optical computing. They also often find application in **holographic optical tweezers**.

>Liquid crystal SLMs can help solve problems related to **laser microparticle manipulation**. In this case spiral beam parameters can be changed dynamically.

###spiral phase plate:

>旋光片

###four-quadrant inverse tangent:

>atan2

>用函数描述图像的图

###speckle decorrelation

>The random noise of the laser speckle field which develops at the focusing plane of an imaging system, is, by now, efficiently used in several interferometric techniques as an information carrier of the macroscopic wavefront distortion induced by the surface displacement field of the object under investigation. The actual noise in this kind of techniques is represented by the speckle decorrelation at the image plane — i.e. the destruction of the carrier — which may be caused by the modification of the texture surface (e.g. by yielding under a severe stress state), but it is inherently produced by the same displacement field under measurement.

###Bilinear interpolation
