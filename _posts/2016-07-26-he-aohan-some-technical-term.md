###Spatial light modulator:

> Usually, an SLM modulates **the intensity of the light beam**. However, it is also possible to produce devices that modulate **the phase of the beam** or both the intensity and the phase simultaneously.

> SLMs have been used as a component in optical computing. They also often find application in **holographic optical tweezers**.

>Liquid crystal SLMs can help solve problems related to **laser microparticle manipulation**. In this case spiral beam parameters can be changed dynamically.
