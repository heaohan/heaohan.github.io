Hi, my name is Aohan! I’m a Senior Software Engineer at Seagate’s EDE team in Singapore. My role involves collaborating with a multidisciplinary team to develop machine vision solutions for assembly equipment.

I am always on the lookout for things that intrigue and inspire me. Here are a few of my passions:

- Coding: I love coding because it reveals the beautiful logic and creativity that lie beneath the surface of problem-solving.
- Basketball: Playing basketball allows me to experience teamwork, strategic communication, and the thrill of competition on both physical and mental levels.
- Music: Learning the electronic keyboard helps me appreciate the artistry and emotion crafted by brilliant composers.
- Gaming: I enjoy immersive and thought-provoking video games like Dark Souls and The Witcher. These virtual worlds are vivid, engaging, and often profoundly moving.
- Liverpool FC: As a devoted fan, I find their fighting spirit both inspiring and motivating.

If you share similar interests or simply enjoy great conversations, I’d be happy to connect!
