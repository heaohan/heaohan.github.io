My name is Aohan. I am a Senior Software Engineer at Seagate EDE team, Singapore. The role involves working within a multidisciplinary team to carry out machine vision development for assembly equipment.

I always want to seek something intrigues me.

- I like coding because I can feel and enjoy the inside beautiful logics when I do it.
- I like playing basketball because I enjoy the cooperation and communication with teammates and competition with rivals both physically and mentally.
- I like learning electronic keyboard because it further helps me enjoy the beautiful melodies composed by all those great musicians.
- I like playing great video games such as DarkSoul and Witcher, since the virtual worlds they created are so vivid, interesting, moving & thought-provoking.
- Finally, I am a fan of Liverpool Football Club. Their fighting spirit always inspires me.
