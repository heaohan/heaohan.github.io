	<h1>Hi there, I'm He Aohan!</h1>
	<p>I am a software engineer at Semiconductor Technologies & Instruments Pte Ltd.
		The role involves working within a multidisciplinary team to carry out
		image processing / computer vision algorithm development for automatic wafer inspection equipment.
		
	I always want to seek something interests me. I like coding because its inside logic is beautiful and I can feel and enjoy it when I do it myself.
		I like playing basketball because I enjoy the cooperation and communication with teammates and competition with rivals both physically and mentally.
		I like learning electronic keyboard because it further helps me enjoying the beautiful melodies conducted by all those great musicians.
		I like playing great video games such as DarkSoul and Witcher, since the virtual worlds they created are so vivid, interesting, moving & thought-provoking.
		Finally, I am a fan of Liverpool Football Club. Their fighting spirit always inspire me.
